### Description:

This project involves creating a Morse code translator in C that controls an LED on the Milk-V Duo to blink Morse code representations of text inputs. The objective is to blend software development with hands-on hardware interaction, focusing on embedded systems programming, C language, and unit testing using Unity.

#### How to:
``` 
make clean      <= Cleans project

make prepare    <= Version without test or debug statements
make verbose    <= Version with debug statements
make test       <= Verbose version + Unity tests

make run        <= Runs project. This depends on which version you made.
```
